# FIELD Development Standards

**Drive doc**: `14K-WPGsjoFLHq3ss9rKkgilDrRD8pfvf` — full rules, origin, history

---

## Enforcement

**Smoke test** (`field_smoke.js`) — runs before every push, exit 1 blocks it.  
Assertions A51–A54 are semantic contracts: if they fail, a feature silently does nothing.  
Add a new semantic assertion for every feature that depends on a specific variable name, key format, or call wiring.

**Session type** — declare at session start. Types are mutually exclusive. No mixing.

**Feature freeze** — no TYPE C if Night Owl, ESPN polling, or compound prompt is broken.

---

## Session start checklist

```
0. Read HANDOFF NOTE from previous session doc (first — before everything else)
1. Declare: "SESSION START · Type: [A/B/C/D/E] · Scope: [one sentence]"
2. git pull && cp index.html /home/claude/index.html
3. node field_smoke.js   ← must be 0 failures before touching anything
4. Open relevant canonical doc for this session type
5. TYPE B only: write diagnosis (failure modes) before first code change
6. TYPE C only: write spec (inputs / outputs / call sites) before first code change
```

**Canonical docs** (open the relevant one before starting):
- Build Session List: `1YMgcYTawnVB-QBa7jEZzOLnTfa5uThKi4j3TcNDQe9o`
- Daily Update Reference: `1y_CuzSCh18YKDFjiWaaThBE1opW2LAoaupAwpvEmN58`
- Wow Features: `1h80BrgGXbz6aq3Hgv5LbjhpFkRQjYvd87fOMNJmVMOc`
- UI Evaluation: `1xIZnlczl2kIeslnnzJD1eJrgBu5iw6xgSk1wB1MVyAY`
- Standards (Drive): `1A3OaKNEjR-tASC330R3Aew9TIMwSCj9E`

## Session types — mutually exclusive

| Type | Scope | Commit prefix |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **A** Daily update | `buildTodaySchedule`, `BETTING_LINES_FALLBACK_DATA`, `MEDIA_SPECIALS`, `MLB_DAILY_OVERRIDES` — data only, zero logic | `Daily update YYYY-MM-DD:` |
| **B** Bug fix | One root cause, fully diagnosed first | `Fix: [root cause]` |
| **C** Feature | One feature, spec written first | `Feature: [name]` |
| **D** Audit | Code vs docs gap analysis — fixes become TYPE B | `Audit: [area]` |
| **E** Refactor | Structure only, zero behavior change | `Refactor: [area]` |

---

## Feature freeze triggers (no TYPE C until resolved)

- Night Owl not displaying  
- ESPN polling dead or erratic  
- Compound prompt failing  
- Smoke test failures  
- console.log count > 22  

---

## Rule: verify in browser, not just smoke

Smoke checks structure. It cannot verify a feature fires at runtime.

Before declaring complete: verify in browser **OR** add a semantic smoke
assertion that would catch the specific failure mode.

Mark features verified in browser-only with comment:
```js
// browser-confirmed: [date] [device]
```

---

## Rule: one concern per commit

`"Fix: _weatherCache → wxCache in dramaScoreLive"` ✓  
`"10 underutilization fixes: [10 unrelated changes]"` ✗

---

*Established May 20 2026 after session audit found 3 features that had
never worked despite being documented as complete.*

---

## Rule 8 — Four canonical documents, updated in place

**The four living reference documents. IDs are permanent — never create a new version file.**

| Document | Current ID | Update trigger |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Build Session List** (Master backlog) | `1YMgcYTawnVB-QBa7jEZzOLnTfa5uThKi4j3TcNDQe9o` | Every TYPE B/C session end |
| **Wow Features** | `1h80BrgGXbz6aq3Hgv5LbjhpFkRQjYvd87fOMNJmVMOc` | Any session that implements or modifies a Wow item |
| **UI Evaluation** | `1xIZnlczl2kIeslnnzJD1eJrgBu5iw6xgSk1wB1MVyAY` | Any session with CSS, layout, or card design changes |
| **Daily Update Reference** | `1y_CuzSCh18YKDFjiWaaThBE1opW2LAoaupAwpvEmN58` | Any session that changes broadcast chip rules, thresholds, or update protocol |

**The rule: edit the document, don't create a new one.**  
Date-stamp changes at the top of the doc. Never append "v14", "v15" to the title.  
If a format change is significant, add a `--- REVISED [date] ---` marker inside the doc.

### What to update per session type

**TYPE A (daily update):**  
Daily Update Reference — if any broadcast rule, chip mapping, or daily protocol changed.

**TYPE B (bug fix):**  
Build Session List — if the fix closes a backlog item, mark it ✅ with date.  
Wow Features — if the fix restores or corrects a Wow item behavior.

**TYPE C (feature build):**  
Build Session List — mark item ✅ with date and actual time spent.  
Wow Features — if the feature is a Wow item, update its status and implementation notes.  
UI Evaluation — if any new CSS class, layout section, or design pattern was added.  
Daily Update Reference — if the feature adds a new daily check (e.g. new broadcast chip type).

**TYPE D (audit):**  
Build Session List — re-scope any items found to be already done or newly scoped.  
Any doc where a gap was found — add a note at the top with the audit date and finding.

### Session end checklist addition

After smoke test passes and git push:
1. Open the relevant canonical doc(s) for this session type
2. Make the specific updates listed above
3. Do NOT create a new document — edit the existing one
4. The Drive ID in this table never changes


---

## Rule 9 — Explicit session start and end

### Session start protocol (spoken, not just implied)

Every session opens with a typed declaration before any code is touched:

```
SESSION START
Type: [A / B / C / D / E]
Scope: [one sentence — what this session will accomplish]
Baseline: git pull + smoke test result
```

Example:
```
SESSION START
Type: B
Scope: Fix _weatherCache bug — weather drama bonus never fires
Baseline: 0/50 smoke failures, commit ef09989
```

Without this declaration the session has no defined scope, and scope
creep (the source of "too much being done at once") has no boundary.

**Before any code:**
1. `git pull && cp index.html /home/claude/index.html`
2. `node field_smoke.js` — must be 0 failures
3. Open relevant canonical doc for this session type
4. TYPE B: write diagnosis. TYPE C: write spec. Both in plain text before coding.

---

### Session end protocol (all steps required)

A session is not over until all five of these are complete:

**Step 1 — Code clean**
```
node field_smoke.js   ← 0 failures
git add index.html && git commit -m "[type prefix]: [description]"
git push origin main
cp index.html /mnt/user-data/outputs/sportworld.html
```

**Step 2 — Session documentation**
Write session doc to Drive. Plain text. Title format:
`FIELD App — [Date] Session Documentation`
Covers: what was done, commits, architecture changes, bugs fixed.

**Step 3 — Canonical doc updates (Rule 8)**
Edit the relevant living documents in place for this session type.
Do not create new versions.

**Step 4 — Handoff note**
Write a brief handoff at the end of the session doc:

```
HANDOFF
Last commit: [hash]  File size: [KB]  Smoke: 0/50
Clean state: yes / no — [if no, what's unresolved]
In progress: [anything mid-flight or needs browser verification]
Next session should: [one concrete recommendation]
Blocked on: [anything requiring resolution before TYPE C work]
Watch for: [any known fragile state or timing dependency]
```

This is the document the next session reads FIRST — before any code,
before any canonical docs. It answers "where did we leave off?"

**Step 5 — State the close**
End the session with a typed declaration:
```
SESSION END
```

Nothing below that line is part of the session.

---

### Why this matters

The audit that produced Rule 1 found three features documented as
"working" that had never fired. All three were introduced in sessions
that mixed multiple session types. A typed scope declaration at the
start would have defined a boundary. A handoff note at the end would
have flagged "smoke-verified only — not browser-confirmed."

The handoff note is the most valuable minute of the session.
It converts implicit context into explicit state. The next session
should be able to start in under 60 seconds: read handoff, declare
type, pull, smoke. If the handoff note is missing, the next session
spends the first 10 minutes reconstructing state from docs.


---

## Rule 10 — Automation and enforcement: who does what

### What requires zero user action

**Pre-commit hook** (`scripts/setup.sh` installs it once after cloning):  
`git commit` automatically runs `field_smoke.js`. If any assertion fails,  
the commit is blocked. User cannot accidentally push broken code.  
Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify` — use only when absolutely necessary.

**Claude reads handoff automatically:**  
Every session, Claude reads the latest handoff note from Drive before  
responding to the opening message. No user request needed.

**Claude infers session type:**  
"Run daily update" = TYPE A. "Night Owl is broken" = TYPE B.  
"Build Social Contrarian" = TYPE C. "Audit journalism" = TYPE D.  
Claude states the inferred type and asks for confirmation if ambiguous.  
User never needs to say "TYPE B" — just describe what they want.

**Claude runs end sequence automatically on "document session":**  
1. Runs smoke test  
2. Pushes all changes  
3. Copies `sportworld.html` for download  
4. Writes session doc to Drive  
5. Writes handoff note to Drive  
6. Prompts for canonical doc updates  
7. Declares SESSION END  

### What requires one user action

**Opening message** — declares intent ("fix Night Owl", "daily update May 21").  
That's the session declaration. No type letter required.

**"Document session"** — triggers the full end sequence. Already established.

### What requires setup once

After cloning the repo:
```sh
sh scripts/setup.sh
```
Installs the pre-commit hook. Never needs to run again on that machine.

### What is never automated (requires human judgment)

- **Diagnosis** (TYPE B): Claude writes it, user reads and approves before coding starts.  
- **Feature spec** (TYPE C): Claude writes it, user confirms scope before coding starts.  
- **Canonical doc content**: Claude proposes updates, user reviews before Drive write.  
- **Session scope**: user's opening message defines what this session is for.  
  Claude cannot override that intent.
