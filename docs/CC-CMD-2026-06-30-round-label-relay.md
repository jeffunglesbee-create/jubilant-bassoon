# CC-CMD — Round Label + Two-Legged Aggregate (RELAY)

**Repo:** field-relay-nba ONLY
**Date:** 2026-06-30 (split from CC-CMD-2026-06-30-round-label-aggregate.md)
**Baseline:** field-relay-nba HEAD e4e9aeac
**Companion doc:** docs/CC-CMD-2026-06-30-round-label-client.md (jubilant-bassoon
— separate CC-CMD, separate session, run after this one ships and deploys)
**Builds on:** CC-CMD-2026-06-30-soccer-stats-dual-source.md (shipped —
relay HEAD 4daaf058 — widened /soccer/xg to extractStats(), added
_hasMatchStats and the /soccer/season-form route)

git pull. Read CLAUDE.md. Run `git log --oneline -5` first.

## WHY THIS IS SPLIT FROM THE CLIENT WORK

The original combined doc required one CC session to operate across both
repos in sequence. A real session hit exactly the failure mode that risks:
CC was opened against field-relay-nba, the spec doc lived in jubilant-bassoon
(per the two-repo separation rule — spec files always live in jubilant-bassoon
regardless of target repo), and CC correctly couldn't find it. Splitting into
two single-repo, self-contained CC-CMDs removes the cross-repo juggling
entirely — this doc only ever touches field-relay-nba, start to finish.

**This doc does NOT depend on the client doc.** The client doc DOES depend on
this one shipping and deploying first for the soccer-specific badge (round
label + aggregate). The client doc's NBA/NHL/UFL/MLS-tournament round badge
has no dependency on this doc at all — that data already exists in
postseason_games today.

## BACKGROUND

Confirmed live 2026-06-30: `adaptESPNWCSoccer` (the generic ESPN-soccer
adapter used for every espnLeague-configured competition — not just WC26;
also EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, MLS-via-ESPN, UCL, Europa
League) hardcodes `round: ''` and never reads `comp.notes`, even though
ESPN's bare scoreboard response already carries it for free. Live-verified:
a UCL Round-of-16 fixture (Arsenal at Bayer Leverkusen, event 401862578)
returned `notes: [{"headline": "1st Leg"}]` directly on `competitions[0]`
in the `/scoreboard` response. The tennis adapter elsewhere in this file
already does exactly this pattern (`match.notes?.[0]?.headline`) — just
never ported to the soccer adapter.

For two-legged ties, ESPN's `/summary` endpoint (already fetched by
`/soccer/xg` solely to resolve competitor names) carries a `series` object
on `header.competitions[0]` that's currently discarded entirely:

```json
"series": {
  "title": "Round of 16", "completed": false, "leg": 1, "totalCompetitions": 2,
  "competitors": [
    {"id": "131", "aggregateScore": 1, "team": {"$ref": "..."}},
    {"id": "359", "aggregateScore": 1, "team": {"$ref": "..."}}
  ],
  "events": [{"id": "401862578"}, {"id": "401862581"}]
}
```

`aggregateScore` is pre-computed by ESPN across both legs (handles the
home/away flip between legs correctly) — no goal-summing needed FIELD-side.

**IMPORTANT — scope boundary confirmed 2026-06-30 (HANDOFF b5ab3142):** this
`series`/`aggregateScore` mechanism is ESPN-native and ONLY applies to
ESPN-sourced soccer (the leagues in `handleJournalismCycle`'s LEAGUES array
and `adaptESPNWCSoccer`'s callers). A real two-legged tie was found in the
TELUS Canadian Championship (stats-api-sourced, via the tournament
multiplexer, landed in `postseason_games`) — that source has NO aggregate
field; its two legs are just two independent rows linked only by team-pair
and date proximity. This doc does NOT solve that case. Document it as an
explicit known gap (see KNOWN GAPS below) — do not attempt to handle
stats-api-sourced two-legged ties here.

WC26 soccer already gets a `round` value via a separate mechanism (BSD
group_name lookup, gated to `sport === 'wc26'` only) that overwrites the
adapter's round value after `adaptESPNWCSoccer` runs. That block is correct,
runs after, and is more specific (actual group letter) — it must not be
touched.

---

## PRE-BUILD PROBES (Rule 68)

```bash
# 1. Re-confirm adaptESPNWCSoccer still hardcodes round: '' (may have changed)
grep -n "function adaptESPNWCSoccer" -A 65 src/index.js | grep -n "round:"

# 2. Re-confirm tennis's notes-reading pattern (copy this exact pattern)
grep -n "match.notes" src/index.js

# 3. Re-confirm /soccer/xg's summary fetch + current payload shape — this route
#    was modified 2026-06-30 by the soccer-stats-dual-source CC-CMD (added
#    _hasMatchStats). Confirm the payload object you're adding _series to
#    still has the shape this doc expects (_hasXG, _hasMatchStats, _source,
#    home, away) before editing — if it's drifted further, re-read and adjust.
grep -n "header?.competitions?.\[0\]\|_hasMatchStats" src/index.js

# 4. Confirm the WC26 BSD round-overwrite block is unchanged (must not touch it)
grep -n "group_name) _g.round" -B 3 src/index.js

# 5. Confirm handleV2Games' cfg.espnLeague branch start (Task 2 insertion point)
grep -n "if (cfg.espnLeague)" src/index.js
```

---

## TASK 1 — Round label on every ESPN-sourced soccer game

File: `src/index.js`, `adaptESPNWCSoccer`.

Replace:
```javascript
round:       '',
```
With:
```javascript
round:       comp.notes?.[0]?.headline || comp.notes?.[0]?.text || '',
```

Additive only — the WC26 BSD block runs afterward and still overwrites this
with the more specific group_name when found. Do not modify that block.

---

## TASK 2 — Two-legged aggregate, conditionally fetched

### 2a. Widen `/soccer/xg`'s existing summary fetch

File: `src/index.js`, `/soccer/xg` route. The summary fetch already happens;
extract `series` from the same response instead of discarding it.

After the existing competitor-extraction loop, add:

```javascript
const seriesData = summaryData?.header?.competitions?.[0]?.series?.[0] || null;
let seriesPayload = null;
if (seriesData) {
    const homeAgg = seriesData.competitors?.find(c => c.id === homeId)?.aggregateScore;
    const awayAgg = seriesData.competitors?.find(c => c.id === awayId)?.aggregateScore;
    seriesPayload = {
        title: seriesData.title || null,
        leg: seriesData.leg ?? null,
        totalLegs: seriesData.totalCompetitions ?? null,
        completed: seriesData.completed ?? null,
        homeAggregate: homeAgg ?? null,
        awayAggregate: awayAgg ?? null,
        otherLegEventId: (seriesData.events || []).find(e => e.id !== eventId)?.id || null,
    };
}
```

Add `_series: seriesPayload` to the existing response `payload` object,
alongside `_hasXG`/`_hasMatchStats`.

### 2b. Conditional fetch in `/v2/games` — only call `/soccer/xg` for likely second legs

File: `src/index.js`, inside the `cfg.espnLeague` branch of `handleV2Games`,
after `espnGames` is built.

Do NOT call `/soccer/xg` for every game in the slate — only for games whose
cheap `round` value (from Task 1) indicates a second leg, to avoid an N+1
`/summary` fetch across the full day's schedule:

```javascript
// ── Two-legged aggregate enrichment — only for likely second legs ─────────
// Cheap pre-filter on the free `round` string avoids fetching /summary
// (one extra request per game) for the ~95% of soccer games that aren't
// part of a multi-leg tie. False negatives just mean no aggregate badge —
// degrades silently, never blocks the card.
if (cfg.espnSport !== 'baseball' && !['basketball','australian-football'].includes(cfg.espnSport)) {
    const secondLegGames = games.filter(g =>
        /2nd leg|second leg/i.test(g.round || '')
    );
    if (secondLegGames.length) {
        const relayBase = env.RELAY_BASE || 'https://field-relay-nba.jeffunglesbee.workers.dev';
        await Promise.all(secondLegGames.map(async g => {
            try {
                const eid = (g.espnEventId || '').toString();
                const resp = await fetch(
                    `${relayBase}/soccer/xg?league=${encodeURIComponent(cfg.espnLeague)}&event=${encodeURIComponent(eid)}`
                );
                if (!resp.ok) return;
                const d = await resp.json();
                if (d?._series) g.series = d._series;
            } catch (_) { /* non-blocking */ }
        }));
    }
}
```

Place after the existing AFL/BSD enrichment blocks, same pattern
(non-blocking, try/catch per game, never aborts the response).

---

## TASK 3 — Smoke assertions

field-relay-nba has no smoke.js (confirmed absent 2026-06-30). Verify these
conditions directly instead, per Task 4 below — do not create a new smoke
framework for this.

- `/soccer/xg` response includes a `_series` key (null when not applicable)
- `/v2/games` does NOT call `/soccer/xg` for games where `round` doesn't
  match `/2nd leg|second leg/i`

---

## TASK 4 — Verify end-to-end (live, post-deploy)

```bash
# 1. Round label now populated for a live club-league game (not just WC26)
curl -s "https://field-relay-nba.jeffunglesbee.workers.dev/v2/games?sport=epl&date=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(g.get('round'), g['home']['name'], 'v', g['away']['name']) for g in d.get('games',[])]"

# 2. Series/aggregate populated for a confirmed second-leg fixture — find one
#    via live ESPN scoreboard search first (the June 2026 UCL example used
#    during doc-writing has long since resolved):
curl -s "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/uefa.champions/scoreboard?dates=$(date -u +%Y%m%d)" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(e['id'], e['competitions'][0].get('notes')) for e in d.get('events',[])]"
# Then test that event id:
curl -s "https://field-relay-nba.jeffunglesbee.workers.dev/soccer/xg?league=uefa.champions&event={EVENT_ID}" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('_series'))"
# If no live second-leg fixture exists today, this step may need to wait for
# one — note this in the outbox rather than fabricating a pass.

# 3. Confirm N+1 avoidance — a full day's EPL/La Liga slate triggers zero
#    /soccer/xg calls unless a real second-leg fixture exists (rare in normal
#    league play; confirms the pre-filter, not a false "always fetches" path)
```

---

## DEPLOY — CRITICAL, do not skip

**This changes runtime code.** Do NOT include `[skip ci]` in the commit
message — a prior session in this repo did exactly that by reflex (copying
the pattern from doc-only commits) and silently suppressed the deploy for a
real code change, caught only by a post-commit live probe. After pushing:

```bash
# Confirm the push triggered deploy.yml automatically (it watches src/**)
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $FIELD_PAT" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/jeffunglesbee-create/field-relay-nba/actions/runs?per_page=1" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; r=json.load(sys.stdin)['workflow_runs'][0]; print(r['status'], r.get('conclusion'), r['head_sha'][:10])"
# If it didn't trigger (e.g. you also touched [skip ci] somewhere), manually
# dispatch: POST .../actions/workflows/deploy.yml/dispatches {"ref":"main"}
# Wait for completion (poll every 30s) before running Task 4 verification —
# testing against an undeployed bundle will produce false negatives.
```

## SCOPE (Rule 69 — TOUCH-ONLY-A)

Repo: field-relay-nba only.

DO:
- `adaptESPNWCSoccer` round fix (Task 1)
- `/soccer/xg` series extraction (Task 2a)
- Conditional second-leg enrichment in `handleV2Games` (Task 2b)
- Confirm deploy actually ran (not just pushed)
- Single commit (or tightly sequenced commits with no gap — GitHub Contents
  API is one-file-per-call; if editing index.js only, this is naturally one
  commit)

DO NOT:
- Touch the WC26 BSD round-overwrite block
- Fetch `/soccer/xg` unconditionally for every soccer game
- Build FIELD-side aggregate-score computation — ESPN's `aggregateScore`
  already does this correctly
- Attempt to solve stats-api-sourced two-legged ties (TELUS Canadian
  Championship and similar) — different data model, no aggregate field,
  needs its own spec
- Touch jubilant-bassoon — that's the companion doc, separate session
- Include `[skip ci]` in any commit message for this work

## KNOWN GAPS TO DOCUMENT (not solve here)

1. Domestic cups with occasional two-legged early rounds may phrase ESPN's
   `notes` differently than "1st/2nd Leg" — the regex pre-filter may miss
   some. Note any misses found during Task 4 verification.
2. **Stats-api-sourced two-legged ties have no aggregate-score data model.**
   Confirmed present in production data (TELUS Canadian Championship
   Quarterfinals, Jul 9–14 2026, two legs as independent `postseason_games`
   rows with no linking field). This doc's `series`/`aggregateScore`
   mechanism is ESPN-specific and does not — cannot — cover this. A future
   CC-CMD would need to either (a) compute aggregate scores FIELD-side from
   the two linked rows once a leg-pairing scheme exists, or (b) accept that
   stats-api tournaments show round label only, no aggregate, until that's
   built. Out of scope here.

---

## OUTBOX MANIFEST (last task)

Write `outbox/cc-round-label-relay-2026-06-30.md` with: probe results
(especially probe 3 — confirm the dual-source-modified payload shape),
Task 4 verification output, any "1st/2nd Leg" phrasing variants found,
final relay HEAD sha, and explicit confirmation the deploy actually ran
(workflow run id + conclusion).
