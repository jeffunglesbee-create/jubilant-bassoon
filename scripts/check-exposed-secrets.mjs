// No known-exposed credential may appear more often than its declared count.
//
// PORTED FROM field-relay-nba 2026-08-25, and the port IS the point.
//
// The relay's copy was written that morning, measured 114 occurrences of the
// shared secret, and the result was reported as "the exposure". It was the
// exposure IN ONE REPO. A later scan across all four found this repository
// carrying both credentials — including the Odds API key, which had just been
// declared removed and ratcheted to 0. "Removed" meant removed from the relay.
//
// A credential does not respect repository boundaries and neither can the check
// that looks for it. Every repo gets its own copy; that is the whole fix.
//
// WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A BAN
//
// The Odds key is 0 here — it appeared only in prose (two docs and one quoted
// code sample) and is deleted. The shared secret is load-bearing: it appears in
// a Worker's auth comparison and in scripts that POST to a credentialled write
// path, and removing the literals before ROTATING the value buys nothing (it is
// in git history either way) while risking an auth check that compares a header
// against `undefined`.
//
// A check that demanded 0 for both would be red on main from the moment it
// shipped, and a red check nobody can make green is a check that gets deleted.
// So each secret declares a maximum. Growing past it fails; shrinking is a fix
// and the number comes down in the same commit.
//
// The VALUES are never in this file or in docs/exposed-secrets.sha256 — only
// SHA-256 hashes. This script hashes every whitespace-delimited token and every
// quoted string it finds and looks the digests up, so it never needs to know
// what it is looking for.
