"""Every push-retry loop must be followed by a check that the push landed.

WHY THIS EXISTS, from 107 committed instances across four repos.

    for i in 1 2 3; do
      git pull --rebase --autostash origin main && git push origin main && break
      sleep $((i * 5))
    done

When every attempt fails the loop's last command is `sleep`, so the loop exits
0, the step is GREEN, and the artifact is silently lost. `set -e` does not catch
it: a failing `&&` list is a tested command, so -e is suppressed. Measured under
the exact Actions shell (bash -e -o pipefail) -> exit 0.

Found because a session's own ad-hoc push printed "PUSHED" after four failed
attempts. The same shape was already committed 82 times here, 23 in
field-relay-nba, 3 in field-laboratory.

THE SWEEP FOUND FIVE VARIANTS BY REFUSING TO GUESS. A 4-attempt loop, a
different sleep multiplier, a one-liner, an `echo "retrying..."` between push
and sleep, and one file that pushes first and pulls last. A looser matcher would
have half-matched and mangled them. A sixth variant will arrive the same way —
someone copies a workflow — which is what this check is for.

IT DOES NOT CHECK THE SHAPE OF THE LOOP. It checks that a landing verification
follows it. That is deliberate: policing loop shapes means enumerating them, and
the enumeration is exactly what proved incomplete five times.
