# FIELD HANDOFF

## SESSION END — 2026-07-03 (chat-side review/verification session, no new features shipped by this session)

**CLIENT HEAD: this file's own commit supersedes 4fe971b/f6b7bdd — always re-run `get_head_sha` fresh rather than trusting a value carried over from earlier in a session (it lagged real `main` by one commit at last check).**
**RELAY HEAD SRC: e3d7b92** / **RELAY DEPLOYED: e3d7b92** — deploy_match: true, deployed_at 2026-07-03T23:21:14Z (per live `session_health`)
**SMOKE: 826 total (825 passed, 1 failed) — RECONCILED this session via direct `git clone` + `node smoke.js` (ground truth, not the MCP tool). The 763 `get_smoke_count` MCP figure is the same known structural undercount documented since 2026-06-22 (tool runs without the repo file tree, can't resolve filesystem-dependent assertions — ~63-assertion gap, consistent with the historical ~62). Not a regression. Prior HANDOFF's 823/0 is consistent with 826/1 modulo normal session-to-session assertion growth.**
**LIVE FAILURE (real, not a tool artifact): A704 — HANDOFF.md required-fields check — was failing because the prior regeneration of this file dropped the SW_VERSION field entirely (`includes('SW')` check). Fixed in this edit.**
**SW_VERSION: 2026-07-03a** (index.html and sw.js confirmed in sync via direct repo grep, 2026-07-03)
**LAST KNOWN-GOOD CI RUN: commit 1de2c25, 2026-07-04T00:30-00:36Z, all 4 checks green via manual `workflow_dispatch`** (Smoke Test + Live Verify — all 6 internal jobs including static/live smoke, viewport invariants, browser runtime tests — plus Desktop Safari Viewport Audit, Desktop Chrome Viewport Audit, Code Map L3). Triggered manually using the documented PAT pattern (`POST .../actions/workflows/{name}/dispatches`) since both `f6b7bdd` and `1de2c25` were `[skip ci]` doc-only commits that CI's push trigger would never have picked up on its own.
**CI GAP: CLOSED.** HEAD has since auto-advanced twice more via harmless bookkeeping commits that followed the dispatched runs — `1de36b5` (`ci: update current state 1de2c25 [skip ci]`) then `34268e2` (`codemap: refresh from 1de36b5 [skip ci]`). Neither touches app code (FIELD-CURRENT-STATE.md and CODE_MAP.json only) — this is the same normal auto-commit pattern documented elsewhere in this file, not a new gap. The tested commit (`1de2c25`) is the one containing the actual A704/SW_VERSION fix.

## WHAT THIS SESSION ACTUALLY DID

This was a verification/governance session (chat-side, FIELD Handoff MCP only — no relay-repo source access, client-repo read-only used for HANDOFF/HEAD checks). No code was written or deployed. Work was: review the open CC-CMD queue and incident list, live-verify claimed fixes against real endpoints rather than trusting codex status fields, close what was confirmed, leave open what wasn't, and catch that this very file had gone stale.

**Live-verified and closed this session (incident category, status:resolved):**
- `cf/2026-06-22/nfl-sporttov2--september-9-deadline` — confirmed via direct curl: `GET /v2/games?sport=nfl` and `?sport=cfb` both return well-formed responses (0 games today = correct, July off-season). Structural "Unknown sport" gap is closed. Recommend one more live check near Sept 10 (real in-season data) before fully trusting it.
- `cf/2026-06-22/odds-story-materializer--cc-cmd-exists-` — confirmed via `GET /odds-story/preview?date=2026-07-02`: missingClosing:0, hasClosing:true across sampled games, one real story materialized (Mercury/Storm). Closing-odds capture path is live.
- `cf/2026-06-22/nbaclutch--nhlseries-r2-stale` — reclassified resolved-as-expected (off-season staleness by design, not a defect; re-open only if still stale after each season's opening week).
- `carry-forwards/june-22` — the 18-item bundle re-audited item-by-item. 7 confirmed resolved with cited evidence, 3 flagged "likely resolved but not independently re-verified this session" (WC label consistency, quality-scoring backfill, golf ESPN-summary coverage), 7 still genuinely open with zero evidence of a fix (see below). Not closed as a whole — left open, annotated.

**Explicitly NOT closed (checked, evidence insufficient):**
- `CC-CMD-2026-07-01-completion-triggered-journalism.md` — manual `POST /journalism/game-complete` returns `{ok:true}`, so the endpoint is deployed and responding. But this session had no relay-repo source access to confirm the GameDO state-transition hook actually *fires* it automatically at real game-final, vs. it only being manually callable. Marked "partially_verified," not done. **Still needs: observe a real live game ending and confirm the trigger fires without manual intervention.**
- `cf/2026-07-03/gap-sweep-cc-cmds-written` — these are freshly-written CC-CMDs (relay field-mismatch sweep, client spec-vs-shipped sweep) queued for Claude Code to execute. Genuinely pending, nothing to verify yet.

## OPEN ITEMS FOR NEXT SESSION (verified-current as of 2026-07-03 chat review)

1. ~~Smoke count discrepancy~~ — RECONCILED: 826 total (825/1) is ground truth, `get_smoke_count` MCP's 763 is the known structural undercount.
2. ~~HEAD vs last CI-verified commit~~ — CLOSED via manual `workflow_dispatch` against `1de2c25` (see above). All 4 CI checks confirmed green. Current HEAD (`34268e2`) is two bookkeeping-only commits ahead of the tested commit — not a new gap.
3. **`resolveEntity`/`CANONICAL_PLAYER`** — this file previously called this "never executed." That was stale: codex confirms it shipped and was verified live 2026-07-02 (`CC-CMD-2026-07-01-identity-resolver-generalize.md`, status DONE). No longer an open item — flagging the correction so it doesn't get resurrected again.
4. **Completion-triggered journalism real-game confirmation** — endpoint live, auto-trigger-on-real-completion still unconfirmed (see above).
5. **`wentToOT` hardcoded false** — D1 lacks column, needs GameDO/AmbientDO write. No evidence of fix found this session.
6. **KV editorial keys** (`field:circadian:preview:{date}`) not consulted by newspaper endpoint. No evidence of fix found.
7. **`session_health` phase-degradation signal gap** — no evidence of fix found.
8. **WNBA archive gap** (1 game missing June 21) — minor, historical, unconfirmed either way.
9. **Client-side third-place SSE speed** — still decoupled from BracketDO's 30s cooldown per original note, unconfirmed either way.
10. **v4 voice register in relay** — unconfirmed either way; if still missing, per-game briefs still lack personality.
11. **Prompt Observatory** — never built per last check; AI Gateway data still unread. Unconfirmed either way this session.
12. **Gap-sweep CC-CMDs** (relay field-mismatch sweep, client spec-vs-shipped sweep) — written 2026-07-03, awaiting Claude Code execution.
13. Everything in the 2026-06-30 handoff's priority list not touched since (MLS club-ID identity mapping, golf Broadie proxy, European club coverage, two-legged tie aggregates) — still open, not re-verified.

## CURRENT QUALITY/ANALYTICS STATE (per live `session_health`, 2026-07-03T23:50Z)

- Degraded quality scoring on: game_brief (x2), game_recap (x5), mlb_game, night_owl (x2) — not investigated this session, just surfaced.
- `night_stars` analytics phase degraded for 2026-07-02 (structural trigger flaw, per earlier-session diagnosis — not re-investigated this session).
- All other analytics phases (field_pick, circadian_preview, truth_is, morning_report, circadian_late, streak_board, quality_feedback, quality_alert) reporting not-degraded.

SESSION END DECLARED: RELAY e3d7b92 deployed, deploy_match true · Smoke 826 total (825 passed, 1 failed — A704, fixed in this edit) · CI green on 1de2c25 via manual workflow_dispatch (see above) · MCP `get_smoke_count`'s 763 is a known structural undercount, reconciled this session, not a regression · via chat, FIELD Handoff MCP only, no relay-repo source access this session. This session did governance/verification work only (incident cleanup, doc-staleness fix x2, CI-gap closure) — no app features shipped, no app code touched.
