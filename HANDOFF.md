## SESSION CLOSE-OUT — 2026-07-18, golf scoring columns (supersedes previous)

**HEAD:** ff5e052
**Smoke count:** 958/0
**SW version:** 2026-07-18a
**Session doc:** docs/outbox/cc-session-2026-07-18-golf-scoring-columns.md
**Session doc:** docs/outbox/cc-session-2026-07-18-esbuild-phase7-corrected.md

**esbuild thread COMPLETE (Phases 1–7):** 23 symbols extracted across 16 modules. Final extraction: isFeaturedTierGame → src/utils/tier-game.js (4506c27). MY_TEAMS explicitly out of scope (live mutable user preference state). CI fully green. smoke.js A-FTO-2 updated to read body from module file.

**esbuild thread status:** Phase 1 through Phase 5 complete and independently verified (every single one via real, directly-inspected job logs, not trusted from a local dry-run alone — this discipline exists specifically because Phase 1's own build script had a real wrong-script-block bug that reached production once and survived by luck, not design). 19 functions extracted across 13 modules (Phase 3 series) + 1 constant/function pair (Phase 5, `WX_DIR`+`cardinalDir`) — the constant-extraction pattern is confirmed to extend cleanly, not just theorized.

**Dispatched this session, not yet executed:**
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-18-esbuild-phase6.md` — `VENUE_COORDS`+`isOutdoorVenue`+`getVenueCoords`, same proven template
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-18-esbuild-phase7.md` — `MY_TEAMS`+`isFeaturedTierGame`, explicitly checks real mutability before assuming the read-only pattern applies
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-18-module-script-investigation.md` — investigation-only, whether `<script type="module">` is safe given the 54 real `window.X=` boot-order dependencies Phase 1 mapped
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-17-golf-scoring-columns.md` (+ relay pair `field-relay-nba/docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-17-golf-green-light-wasted-green-relay.md`'s real successor) — birdies/bogeys/doubles PGA leaderboard columns, the real-available-fields replacement after Green Light Rate/Wasted Green was confirmed permanently blocked (ESPN has no per-hole GIR data, verified 4 independent ways)

**Genuine dead-ends — files exist on disk but should NOT be dispatched:**
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-18-domain-consolidation.md` — directly superseded by Phase 4's own real evidence (explicitly evaluated and rejected as "not compelling," the 13 modules are already well-scoped)
- `docs/CC-CMD-2026-07-17-golf-green-light-wasted-green.md` (+ relay pair) — closed via real, live evidence; `golf-scoring-columns` is the actual live successor

**Still deliberately held, unchanged, real product-sequencing decision not mine to make:**
- 5 Amnesty Zone CC-CMDs (arc-poster, bottom-sheet, card-face, leaderboard-client, leaderboard-relay) — real foundation now exists (`getDramaGateway`, live since July 17) but "foundation exists" isn't the same as "the other 35 ad-hoc drama-state-check sites all route through it"

**Real, smaller carry-forwards, unchanged since July 17:**
- Gap 5/Gap 6 (context/game field name, enrichment brief types) — blocked, no authoritative definition
- Haiku 4.5 "clinical/surgical efficiency" phrasing — worth a `BANNED_PHRASES` addition, not done
- Game-brief exemplar injection — real, scoped, not done
