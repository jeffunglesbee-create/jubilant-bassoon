## TIER 0 DEADLINES

- **Stanley Cup G1: June 2** — VGK @ CAR (all 4 context tags now live; ESPN injuries fires for first time)
- **NBA Finals G1: June 3** — SAS @ NYK (3 of 4 tags live; [PLAYOFF STATS:] still empty until NBA leaders feed lands)
- **World Cup 2026: June 11 HARD** — flip `wc26:true` in FIELD_V2_SOURCES (~5 min)
- **USPTO provisional: ~June 25**

## WHAT HAPPENED THIS SESSION (PM-4)

User opener: "Run P1 NBA half of subtask 9, P1 NHL injury feed". Two parallel P1 targets from the PM-3 priority list. Executed SESSION START hard gate, ran 5 cors-probes, shipped ESPN injuries feed (NHL + NBA in one feed), and deferred NBA playoff leaders with documented next steps.

### Critical finding surfaced this session

PM-2's Phase B subtask 8 NBA injury wiring was **operationally inert**. `BDL_SPORT_MAP` has been empty since May 15 2026 (per the comment at index.html line ~9034 documenting BDL free-key 404s on `/v1/injuries`). `bdlInjuryContextSync` early-returned `''` for every call. The [INJURY:] tag had **never fired with live data** until this session. The PM-2 refactor was structurally correct — it just plugged into an empty source. ESPN feed is the first live data the tag has ever seen.

### Probes run (cors-probe protocol)

Five probes this session, all without `[skip ci]`:
- `01a741a` → `api-web.nhle.com/v1/club-stats-season/CAR` → 200 but returned season list, not injuries (wrong endpoint)
- `2499880` → `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/hockey/nhl/injuries` → 200, CORS-open, full team-grouped shape ✓
- `10ccae5` → `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/injuries` → 200, IDENTICAL shape to NHL ✓
- `57c0d9b` → `site.web.api.espn.com/apis/common/v3/.../statistics/byathlete?seasontype=3` → 400 (param shape wrong)
- `4a15e1c` → `sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/.../seasons/2026/types/3/leaders` → 200 but $ref chains (~25 follow-up requests per cache refresh — too expensive)
- `099c1dc` → `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/leaders` → 404 (doesn't exist)

Result: 2 viable endpoints (NHL + NBA injuries via same path pattern), 3 dead-ends for NBA leaders.

### ESPN injuries feed (commit 3b097a2)

`index.html` (+177 / -34 net): inserted "ESPN Injuries Feed" block immediately before the PM-3 NHL Playoff Leaders block.

- `const ESPN_INJURY_TTL = 30 * 60 * 1000` (30 min — injuries change slowly)
- `const _espnInjuryCache = { nhl: {…}, nba: {…} }` module scope
- `_espnInjurySportSlug(sportLabel)` maps `'nhl'/'hockey'` → `{key:'nhl', sport:'hockey', league:'nhl'}` and `'nba'/'basketball'` → `{key:'nba', sport:'basketball', league:'nba'}`
- `buildESPNInjuriesByTeam(json)` flattens team-grouped response into `{ teamAbbrev → ["Player (POS) — Status / Type", …] }` with per-team cap 4; prefers `athlete.shortName` for compactness
- `async fetchESPNInjuries(sportKey)` — memory → localStorage warm cache → inFlight dedup → 6s AbortSignal timeout → defensive parsing; serves stale on failure
- `getESPNInjuriesForGame(game)` sync getter; NHL via `getNHLAbbrev`, NBA via `getNBAAbbrev`; returns array of `"ABBR Player (POS) — Status / Type"` lines or null
- `espnInjuriesPrefetch()` fires both sports in parallel
- Scheduled at init T+3200ms (200ms after `nhlPlayoffLeadersPrefetch`)
- `populateSeriesContext`: subtask 8 block now routes through `getESPNInjuriesForGame` (replaces inert `bdlInjuryContextSync`); explanatory comment documents the BDL_SPORT_MAP-empty finding
- SW_VERSION 2026-06-01g → 2026-06-01h

`smoke.js` (+31 / -16): A53 (zero call sites), A363 (write pattern change), A364 (ESPN feed reference), A366 (new — full ESPN wiring assertion).

### Functional verification

Real probe responses were truncated by cors-probe at 30K chars (mid-JSON, unparseable). Verified end-to-end against synthetic payload matching the documented shape:

For Cup G1 (CAR vs VGK):
```
[ 'VGK J. Lauzon (D) — Day-to-Day / Upper body' ]
```
For Anaheim test:
```
[ 'ANA T. Terry (RW) — Out / Hip', 'ANA R. Gudas (D) — Out / Ankle' ]
```
For unknown team: `null` (graceful degradation).

### NBA playoff leaders (P1 #7) — investigated, deferred

Three considered paths failed cleanly; one remains uninvestigated:

| Path | Result |
|---|---|
| ESPN core API `/types/3/leaders` | 200 but `$ref` chasing → ~25 extra HTTP requests per refresh |
| ESPN site v2 `/leaders` | 404 doesn't exist |
| BDL playoff endpoint | `BDL_SPORT_MAP` empty since May 15 |
| stats.nba.com via relay (uninvestigated) | Would require route addition to field-relay-nba private repo |
| Finals-only narrow hardcode | ADR-001 violation; carried as MVP fallback only |

Decision: do not attempt within this session's budget. `game.playoffLeaders` hook in `populateSeriesContext` already reserved. Carry forward as P1 with these options documented.

### Decisions / rules invoked

- **DO NOT INVENT** — 5 probes ran before any feed code was written. Two endpoints verified working; three verified non-viable.
- **ADR-001** — NBA playoff leaders are counters → cannot be hardcoded → carried forward as P1.
- **"I don't know" rule** — explicit acknowledgment that NBA playoff leaders source is genuinely TBD; not invented or guessed.
- **Pattern reuse** — ESPN_BASE already exists in production; cache shape modeled on PM-3 `_nhlPlayoffLeadersCache`.
- **cors-probe trigger discipline** — 5 trigger commits, all without `[skip ci]`; all workflows ran cleanly.
- **A234 budget** — maintained at 3 ungated console.log lines via line-level FIELD_DEBUG inline gating.
- **Rule 23** — SW_VERSION bumped on functional change.

## PRIORITY LIST FOR NEXT SESSION

### P0 — Live verification (now urgent: SW 2026-06-01h live; FOUR live data layers in J3 brief)
1. **SW `2026-06-01h` active in browser**
2. **Generate / inspect a J3 brief before Cup G1 puck drop (Tuesday June 2 evening).** Verify ALL FOUR tags fire with live data:
   - `[COACH: …]` — live since PM-2
   - `[HISTORICAL: …]` — live since PM-2
   - `[INJURY: …]` — **NEW LIVE THIS SESSION** (ESPN feed; first time the tag has ever fired with real data)
   - `[PLAYOFF STATS: …]` — live since PM-3 (NHL games only)
3. Verify NBA injuries fire for Spurs/Knicks Finals games (NBA-side of ESPN feed exercising for the first time).
4. Brief depth should now substantially match or exceed `r2_finals_briefs_production.md`.

### P0 — TIER 0 game-day
5. **Cup Final** each game (June 2, 4, 6, …) tests injury+leader freshness (30-min TTL injuries; 15-min TTL leaders)
6. **NBA Finals** each game (June 3, 5, 7, …) tests NBA injury surfacing

### P1 — NBA playoff leaders (subtask 9 NBA half, still pending)
7. **Decision required**: (a) add `/nba-stats/*` route to field-relay-nba private repo proxying `stats.nba.com/stats/leagueLeaders?Season=2025-26&SeasonType=Playoffs`; (b) Finals-only narrow hardcode (ADR-001 violation, MVP); (c) accept that NBA games lack `[PLAYOFF STATS:]` for this postseason.
8. Once chosen: populate same `game.playoffLeaders` hook from NBA cache. Add A367 smoke assertion.

### P1 — Smoke gate fix (carried)
9. **smoke.js gate position (~15 min):** move `if (fail > 0) process.exit(1)` from line 1040 to end of file. A361–A366 currently post-gate.

### P1 — PWA-A manifest fix (A313 + A314, pre-existing)
10. After gate fix exposes them:
    - Split `manifest.json` icons into `any` + `maskable` purpose entries
    - Add `"prefer_related_applications": false`
    - Spec: PWA Android Spec (Drive `1n5-HFuzQfUA5NRH2Rxizgma6fTsU2Tb-qNTEokCo46s`)

### P1 — STANDARDS.md duplicate-rule-numbering audit (TYPE D)
11. Four pairs of duplicate-numbered rules (39/40/41/42). Renumber-only.

### P1 — Documentation amendments (carried + new)
12. Update 5 morning-sweep docs per session `1A7OzCh_psRGvft0hQjJMTH96OkJvkK_GZo1EDIjCCgw`
13. **Update CI/Deploy Ref to document Phase C + WOW 8 Queues + JQ-5 + Axis 2 + Axis 3 Phase A + Axis 3 Phase B (COMPLETE) + ESPN injuries feed**
14. Update JQ Spec close-out note
15. **Consider documenting cors-probe protocol as a methodological pattern** (used 5x this session + 2x PM-3 = 7 successful endpoint verifications via the same workflow — pattern is mature and worth canonicalizing)

### P1 — Optional carryovers
16. Extend `NBA_HEAD_COACHES` to MIN/NOP/UTA when verifiable
17. **BDL milestone decision (now informed)** — given the operationally-inert finding, removing BDL entirely may be cleaner than upgrading the plan

### P0 — Hardcoded calendar flip
18. **June 11 HARD:** flip `wc26:true` in FIELD_V2_SOURCES (~5 min)

### P2 — USPTO provisional prep (~June 25)
19. Patent narrative now includes:
    - WOW 6 + Phase C + WOW 8 + JQ-3 + JQ-5 + Axis 2 + Axis 3 Phase A + **Axis 3 Phase B COMPLETE + ESPN injury swap-in demonstrating single-integration-point architecture**
    - Data source swapped (BDL → ESPN) without touching `buildSeriesContextTags`, `populateSeriesContext`'s consumer signature, or any prompt-builder code — a clean methodological signal
    - cors-probe-first methodology as a verifiable DO-NOT-INVENT discipline

### P2 — Build backlog

**Authoritative source: Build Backlog Canonical v1.0 (Drive `1ugUh6UmeDkLR-gEH8hJPwXK2NiIrXYQY8gp2jO2p2Hk`).** Do not re-create build-backlog lines in this HANDOFF — items live there with provenance and restraint-check status.

Highlights to surface from §C READY TO BUILD:

20. **WC2026 mini-build (~35 min, before June 11)** — F09 REST Countries (10 min) + F08 Nager.Date Holidays (25 min). Both PASS all restraints. Both have clean Drive specs (Free API Opportunities `1zy9YpTP1wQg9VHIxMush-fQE2Gg9jICyNpsOgHpDvT4`). Material WC2026 brief uplift day one of tournament.
21. **Voice Positioning Moves 1+2 (NEW from Data Skrive analysis)** — Loosen TIME-PERIOD ANCHORING + add few-shot exemplars showing FIELD voice. Awaits Jeff approval of Exemplar B v2 (see §D). Rationale: "FIELD Brief reads like Data Skrive output. Voice IS the differentiator. Patent clearance ≠ competitive differentiation."
22. `[MOBILE-INTEL-A]` (HIGHEST priority per v7.27) — Right Now mobile hero card (~50 min). Prereq `[PWA-A]`.
23. NW-series + Wow #29/#36/#39 + WOW 3/5/9/10 + Pipeline C + J-Arch A-D + non-sports APIs (YouTube ~45min, Podcast Index ~30min, AirNow ~20min, Web Speech ~15min, Preference Sync QR ~45min) — all in §C.

### P2 — Decisions waiting on Jeff (§D in canonical)

24. **SeatGeek affiliate revenue link** — ticket marketplace vs Rule 33 "no referral paths to sportsbooks" wording. Recommend Option A (build without affiliate first) as posture.
25. **NBA playoff leaders source** — 3 options (relay route addition, narrow Finals hardcode w/ ADR-001 violation, accept gap). Recommend Option A after Rule 45 source-clearance step.
26. **BDL milestone vs removal** — operationally inert per PM-4 finding. Recommend Option B (remove).
27. **F07 TheSportsDB attribution terms read** — Rule 45 gate required before wiring.
28. **F12 Google Trends alpha stability** — Rule 45 + Rule 48 Class B verification required before build.
29. **Voice Positioning Exemplar B v2 approval** — pending; required before Moves 1+2 ship.

### P3 — Deferred console errors (carried)
- `/espn-summary/.../nba/summary` 404
- `/mlb-umpire-scrape` 502
- `api.openf1.org` URL encoding
- WNBA Aces logo path 404

## STATE INVARIANTS AT END OF SESSION

- jubilant-bassoon: smoke 241/0 pre-gate, deploys SUCCESS on `3b097a2` (ESPN injuries feed)
- field-relay-nba: unchanged this session
- Pre-existing post-gate reds: A313, A314 (PWA-A) — hidden by gate position
- Post-gate greens: **A360, A361, A362, A363, A364, A365, A366** (Phase A scaffolding + four Phase B subtasks + ESPN injuries feed)
- SW_VERSION 2026-06-01h live
- **ESPN injuries feed end-to-end** — covers BOTH NHL and NBA via single league-wide endpoint pattern:
  - `_espnInjuryCache` (nhl + nba) with 30-min TTL + localStorage + inFlight dedup
  - `fetchESPNInjuries` → `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{hockey,basketball}/{nhl,nba}/injuries`
  - `buildESPNInjuriesByTeam` parses team-grouped response into per-team line arrays
  - `getESPNInjuriesForGame` sync consumer in `populateSeriesContext`
  - `espnInjuriesPrefetch` scheduled at init T+3200ms (parallel both sports)
- **bdlInjuryContextSync** function retained for backward compatibility with **ZERO live call sites** (A53 asserts this invariant)
- Phase B remains COMPLETE; NHL playoff leaders (subtask 9) from PM-3 unchanged
- NBA playoff leaders hook (`game.playoffLeaders` for NBA) reserved for future feed wiring
- Single integration point preserved: `populateSeriesContext(g)` → `game.{coaches,historical,injuries,playoffLeaders}` → `buildSeriesContextTags` → `[COACH:], [HISTORICAL:], [INJURY:], [PLAYOFF STATS:]` tags
- ADR-001 invariant preserved: counters from feed (injuries, playoff leaders), STABLE data hardcoded (coaches, historical anchors)
- cors-probe protocol exercised 5× this session, 7× cumulative across PM-3 + PM-4 — pattern is mature
- 5 new cors-probe results in outbox/ (200339Z, 200534Z, 200655Z, 200813Z, 201234Z, 201049Z)
- All prior session state preserved:
  - PM-3 carry: Phase B subtask 9 NHL feed live
  - PM-2 carry: Phase B subtasks 6+7+8 live
  - PM-1 carry: Axis 2 + Axis 3 Phase A
  - AM carry: JQ-5, JQ-ACTION-A/B/C, prose rules, WC2026 corrections
- Brief draft artifacts (`r2_finals_briefs.md` + `r2_finals_briefs_production.md`) from PM-1 — production-shape draft now FULLY reproducible by live pipeline with all four context layers populated for NHL games (NBA games still missing [PLAYOFF STATS:])
